## Overview

This repository contains a series of PHP Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) exercises that I completed to solidify my understanding of OOP concepts. Each exercise focuses on a specific aspect of OOP and demonstrates my practical skills in implementing classes, inheritance, encapsulation, polymorphism, and composition in PHP.

## Exercises Completed

1. **Person Class**: Created a `Person` class to practice working with instances and properties.

2. **Student Class**: Expanded on inheritance by creating a `Student` class inheriting from `Person`.

3. **BankAccount Class**: Explored encapsulation principles by implementing a `BankAccount` class.

4. **Shapes and Polymorphism**: Embraced polymorphism and interfaces through shapes and area calculations.

5. **User and Address Composition**: Demonstrated composition by integrating an `Address` class into the `User` class.

## Getting Started

To explore these exercises and review my implementations, you can clone this repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ox0d/PHP-OOP-Practice-project-1.git
